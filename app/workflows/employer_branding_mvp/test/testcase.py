test_case_list = [f"""You are talking to content creator for repurposing some existing content.
Firstly, start the conversation by this message:
`Write a social copy from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWw-dhZ9x8o
Instruction:
- Use tone: warm, friendly, positive
- Use a direct quote from the video`
After that, you will wait for the content creator to respond.
When he responds back with a draft post, let check:
 - if he mentions some refinements along with that post (such as he would say: 'Let's refine this before moving on ...' or some thing like that), 
 let choose some of the refinement options (just some of them) and ask him to do it. After that, if you feel good 
 with new refined post, say 'Great, Thank You!', else keep asking him until you feel good.
 - if only the post is shown, just say 'It looks good, Thank you !'.
