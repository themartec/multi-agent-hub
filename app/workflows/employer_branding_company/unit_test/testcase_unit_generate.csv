    content:\nContent:\nCelebrating National Black Business Month with Lanier's Fine Candies\nBy Gallagher Small Business | Tuesday, August 27, 2024\nShare\nEvery August, the US celebrates National Black Business Month, recognizing the invaluable contribution made by Black-owned businesses to the country's economy. Nearly 10% of all businesses in the US are Black owned (around 3.5 million), and generate over USD217 billion in sales annually. Employing over 1.2 million people, Black-owned companies play a crucial role in the US economy, as well as having a key role in the pursuit of national diversity and equality.1\n\nLanier's Fine Candies is one such business. Founded by Herman Lanier in 2011, this beloved Seattle institution — known for its delicious nutty confections — has become a symbol of tradition, perseverance and entrepreneurial spirit. This year, we revisit Herman Lanier's inspirational journey to check in on his continued success and contributions to the community, and to celebrate his resilience and achievements.\n\nCombining family and sweets\nDriven by his passion and the enthusiastic reviews of his nut-based candies from colleagues at the University of Washington — where he worked as a project manager — Herman Lanier embarked on a new venture that combined his love for family and sweets.\n\nLanier's Aunt Marie was the inspiration behind Lanier's Fine Candies. She handed Lanier a treasured peanut brittle family recipe that became the cornerstone of Lanier's business. The key to his success was perfecting the technique and cooking temperature, skills he had learned from his Aunt Marie.\n\nHowever, Aunt Marie wasn't the only one who influenced Lanier. Among those who guided him along his journey was Tony Ferguson, a cheesecake maker. He emphasized the importance of always doing things right and never resorting to shortcuts. This advice became a guiding principle in Lanier's business.\n\nOvercoming challenges: Getting Lanier's Fine Candies into stores\nLike many small businesses, Lanier's Fine Candies was born in a garage, which was converted into a certified kitchen with a chocolate-colored door — a unique touch reflecting his passion for the craft. From here, he began creating his now-famous nut brittle chocolates and other candies.\n\nWhile building his business from the ground up, Lanier faced many challenges — mainly getting his products into local stores. To overcome the hurdles, he focused on persistence and smart strategies, such as conducting product demos and giving out samples. These strategies allowed him to introduce his candies to customers and store owners, gradually gaining traction and a loyal following through positive feedback and word of mouth.\n\nOne of Lanier's proudest moments was a customer remarking that his candy was \""too pretty to eat,\"" a testament to the care and attention he puts into his work. And soon he had his first breakthrough — a chain of stores expressed interest in his products, validating the wider potential of his candies.\n\nDrawing inspiration from heritage and upbringing\nLanier's approach to producing a quality product and client satisfaction is shaped by his heritage and upbringing around Black-owned businesses. These experiences instilled in him the values of hard work, excellence and community — principles that are still at the heart of his business today.\n\nLanier has ambitious plans for Lanier's Fine Candies, including expanding the business into Atlanta, Georgia, and improving its online presence to reach a wider audience. He also plans for his daughter to take over the business, ensuring the family tradition and their contribution to the community continues.\n\nMentoring and supporting black entrepreneurs\nAs an experienced \""Chief Everything Officer,\"" Lanier now takes it upon himself to guide budding Black entrepreneurs through obstacles they may encounter along the way. He helps new small business owners by connecting them with his trusted partners, including suppliers and designers, establishing a supportive network that promotes growth and collaboration within the community.\n\nIn a country where more than one-in-five Black people believe owning a business is the key to financial freedom,2 Lanier's advice for new entrepreneurs remains simple yet powerful: Persevere and keep moving forward, even in the face of challenges.\n\nAs we celebrate National Black Business Month, Lanier's Fine Candies stands out as an excellent representation of the craftsmanship and perseverance of Black-owned businesses. Herman Lanier's story isn't just about making candies: It's about leaving a legacy, upholding family traditions and giving back to the community.\n\nLanier's Fine Candies is more than a business. To quote its motto, it's about \""making the world a little sweeter.\"" A testimony to the enduring spirit of Black entrepreneurship, Lanier's Fine Candies exhibits the sweet success that comes from dedication and commitment to quality.\n\nGallagher's support: Empowering Underrepresented Entrepreneurs\nGallagher makes sure Herman Lanier is free to pursue his interests without hindrance. For 12 years, Gallagher has supported Herman Lanier and Lanier's Fine Candies with tailored insurance coverage and prompt service. We were able to forge this successful partnership by understanding the unique challenges and opportunities that Black businesses face, and through leveraging our strengths to support the business as it continues to grow.\n\nOur commitment to diversity, equity, ethics and inclusion enables us to empower underrepresented entrepreneurs, honor the past, celebrate the present and encourage future generations of Black business owners.\nTopic: A Gallagher Employee Story From Lanier Gallagher\nInstruction:\n- Write in first person perspective unless explicitly instruct differently.\n- Always pull in direct quotes from Content input where relevant\n- Always generate an outline and confirm with user before writing the full content"

""I chose IBM because it lets me gain\nexperience in different industries that I really, really\nam passionate about and I like to learn about. IBM is such a large company\nthere's so many opportunities and even though it's a big place\nyou can really shape your own career by making your own pathway. A day as a Technology Consultant consists of meeting with lots of different teams, so\nwhether it's the architects, the developers, the business analysts, \nand with those teams you're working to create a collective solution and you're\ntrying to provide something for the clients. In my role as a Technology Consultant is it's never the same, it's never the\nsame, it's wicked because I get to help customers become the best form of them\nthat they can. It can literally go from anywhere from\nfrom helping write commercials, to contracts,\nto helping plan really really big go to market sort\nof strategies. IBM has given me countless training opportunities where I can learn independently or as part of the classroom abroad with\nother IBMers. You really get out what you put in. The best aspect of my work is the people , 100 percent you can't, can't, can't beat that it's always\nthe people for me that's what makes a job enjoyable. You get so many different personalities so many backgrounds,\nso many people who like especially IBM I've met a lot of senior people that\nwant to help you grow as a person but not just in business\noutside as well, they can give you life advice, they want to actually know who\nyou are who they manage as a person. So, I studied Mechanical Engineering in\nuniversity, obviously with that technical background you don't get a lot of\nexposure to business but you do bring that out of the box\nthinking which I think is very important when you're working on projects and\nyou're trying to create new ideas and new innovation. So, I studied Accounting & Finance and everybody thinks that's just numbers,\nbut those numbers really really do help you understand\nthe logic behind the business because everything is built on a business case\nand being able to get down the nitty-gritty of that you can\nconquer the world. One of the things that I thought is that\nwork becomes your life, that was my big misconception before I joined. Since i've\njoined the company I've realised IBM has such a great work-life balance,\nwe actually spend a lot of time outside of work with our colleagues so it's just\nhaving that balance between you know what you do in the day and then having\nthat time at night to unwind. So one area that really stands out to me\nis the support that I receive from my manager, now she's amazing, she really\ncares about her individual graduates and she's always looking for\nfurther opportunities for me to develop myself and to grow my career. Technology Consultants bridge the gap between technology and people\nand with my STEM background I've been able to bring that knowledge as well to\nthe client. The best aspect of working at IBM is the\nsocialising and networking you gain the friends that I made at the beginning of\nmy journey have really stayed throughout the whole time\nand we've gotten closer, helped each other get\nfuture projects and such and just continue motivating each other. Graduate consultants have the opportunity to try so many different\nareas of the business and so many different industries, I feel\nlike I've really found an industry that I love and I can't wait to see where my career takes me.""

Early in my career, I was hesitant to take on more responsibility. When offered a bigger role roughly 5 yrs into my role at GB, my instinct was to decline—I felt comfortable where I was. But when I was asked, ‘How will you grow if you never take on greater challenges?’ That question shifted my perspective and made me realize I had created my own barriers through complacency and self-doubt.
Looking back, that moment was a turning point. I learned to embrace challenges as opportunities to grow, rather than obstacles to avoid. Now, as a mentor and leader, I encourage others to do the same—every problem brings a solution, and every solution is an achievement. Don’t forget to celebrate every win along the way!

A pivotal moment in my career came four years into my journey with Gallagher Canada. As a Senior Financial Analyst returning from maternity leave, I had no direct leader—my manager was on leave, and our CFO had moved on. I took the initiative to connect with our CEO to ensure key deliverables were met. This exposure to senior leadership strengthened my foundation with our next CFO and led to my promotions to National Director and, eventually, CFO (Canada). That moment taught me I had to take control of my own career.
Early in my CFO journey, I battled self-doubt and imposter syndrome. With the support of my colleagues, I overcame these challenges—realizing I had a responsibility to break this cycle and pave the way for future female leaders.
My role is more than a title—it’s about creating change, challenging norms, and inspiring women who may be doubting themselves. Moving forward isn’t just about me; it’s about making space for future leaders.

Early in my career, I faced implicit bias in a male-dominated industry. Despite leading a major prospect’s strategy, questions were directed to my male colleagues, and my input was minimized. During a critical meeting, a client raised a concern about an exclusion clause. While others hesitated, I had anticipated it, explained the clause, and provided a solution. The client acknowledged my expertise, and we won the contract. That moment reinforced the power of preparation, confidence, and client focus.
The bias I faced was subtle but constant, often leading to self-doubt. I learned to trust my expertise, advocate for my ideas, and push through. Instead of confronting every bias, I focused on systemic change—championing inclusive hiring, mentorship, and speaking out.
Resilience comes from my passion for helping clients manage risk. Strong allies and a commitment to progress keep me moving forward—not just for myself, but for the future of women in this industry.

Mentorship played a pivotal role in shaping my career. Two brokers—one past and one present—pushed me beyond my comfort zone, teaching me resilience, adaptability, and the power of confidence. They placed me in rooms where I had to find my footing, and through that, I developed what I call ‘Healthy Arrogance’—the belief in my right to succeed.
Self-doubt was a major barrier, often making me question, ‘Do I belong here?’ I learned to reframe my mindset, replacing negative thoughts with affirmations and focusing on growth. Expanding my skills helped me build confidence and shift my perspective from fear to opportunity.
Momentum comes from celebrating small wins, setting clear goals, embracing technology, and building strong relationships. These factors keep me learning, evolving, and moving forward—not just for myself, but for those who come after me.
