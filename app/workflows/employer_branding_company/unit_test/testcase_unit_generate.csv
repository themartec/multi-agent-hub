Content:\nCelebrating National Black Business Month with Lanier's Fine Candies\nBy Gallagher Small Business | Tuesday, August 27, 2024\nShare\nEvery August, the US celebrates National Black Business Month, recognizing the invaluable contribution made by Black-owned businesses to the country's economy. Nearly 10% of all businesses in the US are Black owned (around 3.5 million), and generate over USD217 billion in sales annually. Employing over 1.2 million people, Black-owned companies play a crucial role in the US economy, as well as having a key role in the pursuit of national diversity and equality.1\n\nLanier's Fine Candies is one such business. Founded by Herman Lanier in 2011, this beloved Seattle institution — known for its delicious nutty confections — has become a symbol of tradition, perseverance and entrepreneurial spirit. This year, we revisit Herman Lanier's inspirational journey to check in on his continued success and contributions to the community, and to celebrate his resilience and achievements.\n\nCombining family and sweets\nDriven by his passion and the enthusiastic reviews of his nut-based candies from colleagues at the University of Washington — where he worked as a project manager — Herman Lanier embarked on a new venture that combined his love for family and sweets.\n\nLanier's Aunt Marie was the inspiration behind Lanier's Fine Candies. She handed Lanier a treasured peanut brittle family recipe that became the cornerstone of Lanier's business. The key to his success was perfecting the technique and cooking temperature, skills he had learned from his Aunt Marie.\n\nHowever, Aunt Marie wasn't the only one who influenced Lanier. Among those who guided him along his journey was Tony Ferguson, a cheesecake maker. He emphasized the importance of always doing things right and never resorting to shortcuts. This advice became a guiding principle in Lanier's business.\n\nOvercoming challenges: Getting Lanier's Fine Candies into stores\nLike many small businesses, Lanier's Fine Candies was born in a garage, which was converted into a certified kitchen with a chocolate-colored door — a unique touch reflecting his passion for the craft. From here, he began creating his now-famous nut brittle chocolates and other candies.\n\nWhile building his business from the ground up, Lanier faced many challenges — mainly getting his products into local stores. To overcome the hurdles, he focused on persistence and smart strategies, such as conducting product demos and giving out samples. These strategies allowed him to introduce his candies to customers and store owners, gradually gaining traction and a loyal following through positive feedback and word of mouth.\n\nOne of Lanier's proudest moments was a customer remarking that his candy was \""""too pretty to eat,\"""" a testament to the care and attention he puts into his work. And soon he had his first breakthrough — a chain of stores expressed interest in his products, validating the wider potential of his candies.\n\nDrawing inspiration from heritage and upbringing\nLanier's approach to producing a quality product and client satisfaction is shaped by his heritage and upbringing around Black-owned businesses. These experiences instilled in him the values of hard work, excellence and community — principles that are still at the heart of his business today.\n\nLanier has ambitious plans for Lanier's Fine Candies, including expanding the business into Atlanta, Georgia, and improving its online presence to reach a wider audience. He also plans for his daughter to take over the business, ensuring the family tradition and their contribution to the community continues.\n\nMentoring and supporting black entrepreneurs\nAs an experienced \""""Chief Everything Officer,\"""" Lanier now takes it upon himself to guide budding Black entrepreneurs through obstacles they may encounter along the way. He helps new small business owners by connecting them with his trusted partners, including suppliers and designers, establishing a supportive network that promotes growth and collaboration within the community.\n\nIn a country where more than one-in-five Black people believe owning a business is the key to financial freedom,2 Lanier's advice for new entrepreneurs remains simple yet powerful: Persevere and keep moving forward, even in the face of challenges.\n\nAs we celebrate National Black Business Month, Lanier's Fine Candies stands out as an excellent representation of the craftsmanship and perseverance of Black-owned businesses. Herman Lanier's story isn't just about making candies: It's about leaving a legacy, upholding family traditions and giving back to the community.\n\nLanier's Fine Candies is more than a business. To quote its motto, it's about \""""making the world a little sweeter.\"""" A testimony to the enduring spirit of Black entrepreneurship, Lanier's Fine Candies exhibits the sweet success that comes from dedication and commitment to quality.\n\nGallagher's support: Empowering Underrepresented Entrepreneurs\nGallagher makes sure Herman Lanier is free to pursue his interests without hindrance. For 12 years, Gallagher has supported Herman Lanier and Lanier's Fine Candies with tailored insurance coverage and prompt service. We were able to forge this successful partnership by understanding the unique challenges and opportunities that Black businesses face, and through leveraging our strengths to support the business as it continues to grow.\n\nOur commitment to diversity, equity, ethics and inclusion enables us to empower underrepresented entrepreneurs, honor the past, celebrate the present and encourage future generations of Black business owners.

Early in my career, I was hesitant to take on more responsibility. When offered a bigger role roughly 5 yrs into my role at GB, my instinct was to decline—I felt comfortable where I was. But when I was asked, ‘How will you grow if you never take on greater challenges?’ That question shifted my perspective and made me realize I had created my own barriers through complacency and self-doubt.
Looking back, that moment was a turning point. I learned to embrace challenges as opportunities to grow, rather than obstacles to avoid. Now, as a mentor and leader, I encourage others to do the same—every problem brings a solution, and every solution is an achievement. Don’t forget to celebrate every win along the way!

A pivotal moment in my career came four years into my journey with Gallagher Canada. As a Senior Financial Analyst returning from maternity leave, I had no direct leader—my manager was on leave, and our CFO had moved on. I took the initiative to connect with our CEO to ensure key deliverables were met. This exposure to senior leadership strengthened my foundation with our next CFO and led to my promotions to National Director and, eventually, CFO (Canada). That moment taught me I had to take control of my own career.
Early in my CFO journey, I battled self-doubt and imposter syndrome. With the support of my colleagues, I overcame these challenges—realizing I had a responsibility to break this cycle and pave the way for future female leaders.
My role is more than a title—it’s about creating change, challenging norms, and inspiring women who may be doubting themselves. Moving forward isn’t just about me; it’s about making space for future leaders.

Early in my career, I faced implicit bias in a male-dominated industry. Despite leading a major prospect’s strategy, questions were directed to my male colleagues, and my input was minimized. During a critical meeting, a client raised a concern about an exclusion clause. While others hesitated, I had anticipated it, explained the clause, and provided a solution. The client acknowledged my expertise, and we won the contract. That moment reinforced the power of preparation, confidence, and client focus.
The bias I faced was subtle but constant, often leading to self-doubt. I learned to trust my expertise, advocate for my ideas, and push through. Instead of confronting every bias, I focused on systemic change—championing inclusive hiring, mentorship, and speaking out.
Resilience comes from my passion for helping clients manage risk. Strong allies and a commitment to progress keep me moving forward—not just for myself, but for the future of women in this industry.

Navigating the Future Together: My Journey as a Mentor at Gallagher
As the Vice President of Gallagher's Bogotá office, I have the privilege of leading a talented team and overseeing all strategic aspects of our local business. With a background in client relationship management and financial risk solutions, I joined Gallagher seven years ago, bringing with me a deep commitment to client satisfaction and operational efficiency. However, one of the most rewarding aspects of my role has been the opportunity to serve as a mentor to the next generation of leaders and professionals within our organization.
The Inspiration to Mentor
My decision to become a mentor at Gallagher stems from my own experiences with mentors who have supported my growth and helped guide me through challenges. These experiences instilled in me the importance of paying it forward and contributing to the development of others. When I joined Gallagher, I saw an opportunity to shape the future by sharing my insights and experiences with the diverse range of talent within our organization.
Mentoring has not only allowed me to help others grow, but it has also enriched my own professional journey. Engaging with fresh perspectives and innovative ideas of my mentees has challenged me to reflect on my own practices and grow alongside them, creating a dynamic and rewarding learning environment for all involved.
Tailoring the Mentoring Approach
One of the key lessons I've learned as a mentor is that a one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work. Every mentee brings their own unique strengths, challenges, and aspirations to the table. To effectively support their growth, I make it a priority to understand their individual needs and career goals through open conversations about their professional background, current challenges, and future aspirations.
Once I have a clear understanding of their objectives, I customize my guidance to align with their specific goals. This may involve providing personalized resources, setting attainable milestones, or connecting them with relevant networking opportunities. By tailoring my approach to each mentee, I can ensure that they receive the support and guidance they need to succeed.
Balancing Guidance and Autonomy
As a mentor, one of the most important aspects of my role is giving my mentees the autonomy to take ownership of their decisions empowering them to learn from their experiences. To achieve this balance, I focus on prioritizing active listening and empathy, asking open-ended questions that encourage critical thinking and self-reflection, and understanding that everyone has unique strengths and challenges.
I also emphasize the importance of learning from mistakes and reassure my mentees that it's okay to fail sometimes, as long as they are learning and growing from the experience. This approach helps build their confidence and decision-making skills over time.
Navigating Challenges Together
One of the most significant challenges I've worked through with a mentee involved navigating the balance between personal ambition and team collaboration. This particular mentee was highly driven and had great potential, but they often found themselves focusing on individual achievements at the expense of building stronger relationships within their team.
To help them overcome this challenge, I encouraged them to shift their approach by actively listening to their colleagues and seeking input from others before pushing forward with their own ideas. This experience reinforced the importance of empathy, active listening, and patience, not just as leadership skills, but as key components of successful collaboration.
The Rewards of Mentoring
Being a mentor at Gallagher has been an incredibly rewarding experience. Seeing my mentees grow, take on new challenges, and succeed in their roles is a testament to the power of mentoring and the impact it can have on an individual's career.
One memorable moment that stands out occurred when I was mentoring a colleague who was struggling with transitioning into a leadership role. By focusing on helping him navigate the softer skills required in leadership and encouraging vulnerability, I watched as he grew more comfortable in his role and his team began to respond more positively.
These experiences have shown me that small shifts in mindset can have a huge impact on someone's professional growth. Furthermore, it has taught me the importance of being open to learning from others, patient adapting to new situations, and continuously seeking ways to improve myself and my leadership style.
To anyone considering becoming a mentor at Gallagher, my advice would be to approach the role with a genuine desire to help others grow. Keep your ears open and create an environment where your mentee feels comfortable taking risks, asking questions, and learning from both successes and failures.
As we navigate the future together at Gallagher, I am excited to continue my journey as a mentor and to see the impact that our collective efforts will have on the success of our company and the growth of our people.

To effectively support their growth, I make it a priority to understand their individual needs and career goals through open conversations about their professional background, current challenges, and future aspirations.
Once I have a clear understanding of their objectives, I customize my guidance to align with their specific goals. This may involve providing personalized resources, setting attainable milestones, or connecting them with relevant networking opportunities. By tailoring my approach to each mentee, I can ensure that they receive the support and guidance they need to succeed.
Balancing Guidance and Autonomy
As a mentor, one of the most important aspects of my role is giving my mentees the autonomy to take ownership of their decisions empowering them to learn from their experiences. To achieve this balance, I focus on prioritizing active listening and empathy, asking open-ended questions that encourage critical thinking and self-reflection, and understanding that everyone has unique strengths and challenges.
I also emphasize the importance of learning from mistakes and reassure my mentees that it's okay to fail sometimes, as long as they are learning and growing from the experience. This approach helps build their confidence and decision-making skills over time.
Navigating Challenges Together
One of the most significant challenges I've worked through with a mentee involved navigating the balance between personal ambition and team collaboration. This particular mentee was highly driven and had great potential, but they often found themselves focusing on individual achievements at the expense of building stronger relationships within their team.
To help them overcome this challenge, I encouraged them to shift their approach by actively listening to their colleagues and seeking input from others before pushing forward with their own ideas. This experience reinforced the importance of empathy, active listening, and patience, not just as leadership skills, but as key components of successful collaboration.
The Rewards of Mentoring
Being a mentor at Gallagher has been an incredibly rewarding experience. Seeing my mentees grow, take on new challenges, and succeed in their roles is a testament to the power of mentoring and the impact it can have on an individual's career.
One memorable moment that stands out occurred when I was mentoring a colleague who was struggling with transitioning into a leadership role. By focusing on helping him navigate the softer skills required in leadership and encouraging vulnerability, I watched as he grew more comfortable in his role and his team began to respond more positively.
These experiences have shown me that small shifts in mindset can have a huge impact on someone's professional growth. Furthermore, it has taught me the importance of being open to learning from others, patient adapting to new situations, and continuously seeking ways to improve myself and my leadership style. 
To anyone considering becoming a mentor at Gallagher, my advice would be to approach the role with a genuine desire to help others grow. Keep your ears open and create an environment where your mentee feels comfortable taking risks, asking questions, and learning from both successes and failures.
As we navigate the future together at Gallagher, I am excited to continue my journey as a mentor and to see the impact that our collective efforts will have on the success of our company and the growth of our people.

As the Vice President of Gallagher's Bogotá office, I have the privilege of leading a talented team and overseeing all strategic aspects of our local business. With a background in client relationship management and financial risk solutions, I joined Gallagher seven years ago, bringing with me a deep commitment to client satisfaction and operational efficiency. However, one of the most rewarding aspects of my role has been the opportunity to serve as a mentor to the next generation of leaders and professionals within our organization.

Across continents, our team members bring diverse experiences and perspectives that contribute to a rich and dynamic tapestry. This month, we’re spotlighting our remarkable employees who exemplify dedication and excellence, from our long-serving colleagues in the USA to the inspiring women balancing career and family in the Middle East and Asia.

Employees like Henry Borovic, with over 40 years of service, contribute invaluable expertise and wisdom. “Our careers are woven from dedication and perseverance—a shared journey that ignites innovation and excellence every day,” he shares, reflecting on his time at AtkinsRéalis.

Similarly, in Asia, Mindy Lai, an Associate Director in Hong Kong, benefits profoundly from our organization’s flexible work arrangements. 'My managers have been incredibly supportive, allowing me to take unpaid leave and even work part-time for a month to ease back into my role,' she notes, emphasizing our commitment to practical solutions that nurture rather than hinder career growth.

These stories symbolize the wider narrative of AtkinsRéalis—a narrative where diverse paths intersect, creating opportunities for growth, learning, and transformation. By providing platforms where distinct voices can share their stories, whether through structured flexibility for working mothers or celebratory dinners for milestone achievements, we cultivate a culture that transcends borders and unites aspirations.
