    content:\nContent:\nCelebrating National Black Business Month with Lanier's Fine Candies\nBy Gallagher Small Business | Tuesday, August 27, 2024\nShare\nEvery August, the US celebrates National Black Business Month, recognizing the invaluable contribution made by Black-owned businesses to the country's economy. Nearly 10% of all businesses in the US are Black owned (around 3.5 million), and generate over USD217 billion in sales annually. Employing over 1.2 million people, Black-owned companies play a crucial role in the US economy, as well as having a key role in the pursuit of national diversity and equality.1\n\nLanier's Fine Candies is one such business. Founded by Herman Lanier in 2011, this beloved Seattle institution — known for its delicious nutty confections — has become a symbol of tradition, perseverance and entrepreneurial spirit. This year, we revisit Herman Lanier's inspirational journey to check in on his continued success and contributions to the community, and to celebrate his resilience and achievements.\n\nCombining family and sweets\nDriven by his passion and the enthusiastic reviews of his nut-based candies from colleagues at the University of Washington — where he worked as a project manager — Herman Lanier embarked on a new venture that combined his love for family and sweets.\n\nLanier's Aunt Marie was the inspiration behind Lanier's Fine Candies. She handed Lanier a treasured peanut brittle family recipe that became the cornerstone of Lanier's business. The key to his success was perfecting the technique and cooking temperature, skills he had learned from his Aunt Marie.\n\nHowever, Aunt Marie wasn't the only one who influenced Lanier. Among those who guided him along his journey was Tony Ferguson, a cheesecake maker. He emphasized the importance of always doing things right and never resorting to shortcuts. This advice became a guiding principle in Lanier's business.\n\nOvercoming challenges: Getting Lanier's Fine Candies into stores\nLike many small businesses, Lanier's Fine Candies was born in a garage, which was converted into a certified kitchen with a chocolate-colored door — a unique touch reflecting his passion for the craft. From here, he began creating his now-famous nut brittle chocolates and other candies.\n\nWhile building his business from the ground up, Lanier faced many challenges — mainly getting his products into local stores. To overcome the hurdles, he focused on persistence and smart strategies, such as conducting product demos and giving out samples. These strategies allowed him to introduce his candies to customers and store owners, gradually gaining traction and a loyal following through positive feedback and word of mouth.\n\nOne of Lanier's proudest moments was a customer remarking that his candy was \"too pretty to eat,\" a testament to the care and attention he puts into his work. And soon he had his first breakthrough — a chain of stores expressed interest in his products, validating the wider potential of his candies.\n\nDrawing inspiration from heritage and upbringing\nLanier's approach to producing a quality product and client satisfaction is shaped by his heritage and upbringing around Black-owned businesses. These experiences instilled in him the values of hard work, excellence and community — principles that are still at the heart of his business today.\n\nLanier has ambitious plans for Lanier's Fine Candies, including expanding the business into Atlanta, Georgia, and improving its online presence to reach a wider audience. He also plans for his daughter to take over the business, ensuring the family tradition and their contribution to the community continues.\n\nMentoring and supporting black entrepreneurs\nAs an experienced \"Chief Everything Officer,\" Lanier now takes it upon himself to guide budding Black entrepreneurs through obstacles they may encounter along the way. He helps new small business owners by connecting them with his trusted partners, including suppliers and designers, establishing a supportive network that promotes growth and collaboration within the community.\n\nIn a country where more than one-in-five Black people believe owning a business is the key to financial freedom,2 Lanier's advice for new entrepreneurs remains simple yet powerful: Persevere and keep moving forward, even in the face of challenges.\n\nAs we celebrate National Black Business Month, Lanier's Fine Candies stands out as an excellent representation of the craftsmanship and perseverance of Black-owned businesses. Herman Lanier's story isn't just about making candies: It's about leaving a legacy, upholding family traditions and giving back to the community.\n\nLanier's Fine Candies is more than a business. To quote its motto, it's about \"making the world a little sweeter.\" A testimony to the enduring spirit of Black entrepreneurship, Lanier's Fine Candies exhibits the sweet success that comes from dedication and commitment to quality.\n\nGallagher's support: Empowering Underrepresented Entrepreneurs\nGallagher makes sure Herman Lanier is free to pursue his interests without hindrance. For 12 years, Gallagher has supported Herman Lanier and Lanier's Fine Candies with tailored insurance coverage and prompt service. We were able to forge this successful partnership by understanding the unique challenges and opportunities that Black businesses face, and through leveraging our strengths to support the business as it continues to grow.\n\nOur commitment to diversity, equity, ethics and inclusion enables us to empower underrepresented entrepreneurs, honor the past, celebrate the present and encourage future generations of Black business owners.\nTopic: A Gallagher Employee Story From Lanier Gallagher\nInstruction:\n- Write in first person perspective unless explicitly instruct differently.\n- Always pull in direct quotes from Content input where relevant\n- Always generate an outline and confirm with user before writing the full content""",
