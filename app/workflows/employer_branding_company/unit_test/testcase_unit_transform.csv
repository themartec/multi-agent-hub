Early in my career, I was hesitant to take on more responsibility. When offered a bigger role roughly 5 yrs into my role at GB, my instinct was to decline—I felt comfortable where I was. But when I was asked, ‘How will you grow if you never take on greater challenges?’ That question shifted my perspective and made me realize I had created my own barriers through complacency and self-doubt.
Looking back, that moment was a turning point. I learned to embrace challenges as opportunities to grow, rather than obstacles to avoid. Now, as a mentor and leader, I encourage others to do the same—every problem brings a solution, and every solution is an achievement. Don’t forget to celebrate every win along the way!

A pivotal moment in my career came four years into my journey with Gallagher Canada. As a Senior Financial Analyst returning from maternity leave, I had no direct leader—my manager was on leave, and our CFO had moved on. I took the initiative to connect with our CEO to ensure key deliverables were met. This exposure to senior leadership strengthened my foundation with our next CFO and led to my promotions to National Director and, eventually, CFO (Canada). That moment taught me I had to take control of my own career.
Early in my CFO journey, I battled self-doubt and imposter syndrome. With the support of my colleagues, I overcame these challenges—realizing I had a responsibility to break this cycle and pave the way for future female leaders.
My role is more than a title—it’s about creating change, challenging norms, and inspiring women who may be doubting themselves. Moving forward isn’t just about me; it’s about making space for future leaders.

Early in my career, I faced implicit bias in a male-dominated industry. Despite leading a major prospect’s strategy, questions were directed to my male colleagues, and my input was minimized. During a critical meeting, a client raised a concern about an exclusion clause. While others hesitated, I had anticipated it, explained the clause, and provided a solution. The client acknowledged my expertise, and we won the contract. That moment reinforced the power of preparation, confidence, and client focus.
The bias I faced was subtle but constant, often leading to self-doubt. I learned to trust my expertise, advocate for my ideas, and push through. Instead of confronting every bias, I focused on systemic change—championing inclusive hiring, mentorship, and speaking out.
Resilience comes from my passion for helping clients manage risk. Strong allies and a commitment to progress keep me moving forward—not just for myself, but for the future of women in this industry.

Mentorship played a pivotal role in shaping my career. Two brokers—one past and one present—pushed me beyond my comfort zone, teaching me resilience, adaptability, and the power of confidence. They placed me in rooms where I had to find my footing, and through that, I developed what I call ‘Healthy Arrogance’—the belief in my right to succeed.
Self-doubt was a major barrier, often making me question, ‘Do I belong here?’ I learned to reframe my mindset, replacing negative thoughts with affirmations and focusing on growth. Expanding my skills helped me build confidence and shift my perspective from fear to opportunity.
Momentum comes from celebrating small wins, setting clear goals, embracing technology, and building strong relationships. These factors keep me learning, evolving, and moving forward—not just for myself, but for those who come after me.""

Celebrating National Black Business Month with Lanier's Fine Candies
By Gallagher Small Business | Tuesday, August 27, 2024
Every August, the US celebrates National Black Business Month, recognizing the invaluable contribution made by Black-owned businesses to the country's economy. Nearly 10% of all businesses in the US are Black owned (around 3.5 million), and generate over USD217 billion in sales annually. Employing over 1.2 million people, Black-owned companies play a crucial role in the US economy, as well as having a key role in the pursuit of national diversity and equality.1

Lanier's Fine Candies is one such business. Founded by Herman Lanier in 2011, this beloved Seattle institution — known for its delicious nutty confections — has become a symbol of tradition, perseverance and entrepreneurial spirit. This year, we revisit Herman Lanier's inspirational journey to check in on his continued success and contributions to the community, and to celebrate his resilience and achievements.

Combining family and sweets
Driven by his passion and the enthusiastic reviews of his nut-based candies from colleagues at the University of Washington — where he worked as a project manager — Herman Lanier embarked on a new venture that combined his love for family and sweets.

Lanier's Aunt Marie was the inspiration behind Lanier's Fine Candies. She handed Lanier a treasured peanut brittle family recipe that became the cornerstone of Lanier's business. The key to his success was perfecting the technique and cooking temperature, skills he had learned from his Aunt Marie.

However, Aunt Marie wasn't the only one who influenced Lanier. Among those who guided him along his journey was Tony Ferguson, a cheesecake maker. He emphasized the importance of always doing things right and never resorting to shortcuts. This advice became a guiding principle in Lanier's business.

Overcoming challenges: Getting Lanier's Fine Candies into stores
Like many small businesses, Lanier's Fine Candies was born in a garage, which was converted into a certified kitchen with a chocolate-colored door — a unique touch reflecting his passion for the craft. From here, he began creating his now-famous nut brittle chocolates and other candies.

While building his business from the ground up, Lanier faced many challenges — mainly getting his products into local stores. To overcome the hurdles, he focused on persistence and smart strategies, such as conducting product demos and giving out samples. These strategies allowed him to introduce his candies to customers and store owners, gradually gaining traction and a loyal following through positive feedback and word of mouth.

One of Lanier's proudest moments was a customer remarking that his candy was ""too pretty to eat,"" a testament to the care and attention he puts into his work. And soon he had his first breakthrough — a chain of stores expressed interest in his products, validating the wider potential of his candies.

Drawing inspiration from heritage and upbringing
Lanier's approach to producing a quality product and client satisfaction is shaped by his heritage and upbringing around Black-owned businesses. These experiences instilled in him the values of hard work, excellence and community — principles that are still at the heart of his business today.

Lanier has ambitious plans for Lanier's Fine Candies, including expanding the business into Atlanta, Georgia, and improving its online presence to reach a wider audience. He also plans for his daughter to take over the business, ensuring the family tradition and their contribution to the community continues.

Mentoring and supporting black entrepreneurs
As an experienced ""Chief Everything Officer,"" Lanier now takes it upon himself to guide budding Black entrepreneurs through obstacles they may encounter along the way. He helps new small business owners by connecting them with his trusted partners, including suppliers and designers, establishing a supportive network that promotes growth and collaboration within the community.

In a country where more than one-in-five Black people believe owning a business is the key to financial freedom,2 Lanier's advice for new entrepreneurs remains simple yet powerful: Persevere and keep moving forward, even in the face of challenges.

As we celebrate National Black Business Month, Lanier's Fine Candies stands out as an excellent representation of the craftsmanship and perseverance of Black-owned businesses. Herman Lanier's story isn't just about making candies: It's about leaving a legacy, upholding family traditions and giving back to the community.

Lanier's Fine Candies is more than a business. To quote its motto, it's about ""making the world a little sweeter."" A testimony to the enduring spirit of Black entrepreneurship, Lanier's Fine Candies exhibits the sweet success that comes from dedication and commitment to quality.

Gallagher's support: Empowering Underrepresented Entrepreneurs
Gallagher makes sure Herman Lanier is free to pursue his interests without hindrance. For 12 years, Gallagher has supported Herman Lanier and Lanier's Fine Candies with tailored insurance coverage and prompt service. We were able to forge this successful partnership by understanding the unique challenges and opportunities that Black businesses face, and through leveraging our strengths to support the business as it continues to grow.

Our commitment to diversity, equity, ethics and inclusion enables us to empower underrepresented entrepreneurs, honor the past, celebrate the present and encourage future generations of Black business owners."

Navigating Safety Leadership: Lessons from the Front Lines
In an industry where the stakes are as high as the structures we create, mastering the art of safety is not just a responsibility—it's a calling. With over thirty years in the industry, I've weathered evolving regulations and the rigors of construction projects. Through it all, my focus has remained unerring: to ensure that each person on the site not only understands compliance but embodies the ethos of safety in every action. My journey, greatly supported by Gallagher's unwavering commitment to growth and excellence, stands as a testament to the dedication required to navigate the future of safety management together.
Overcoming Hurdles
High-rise projects come with numerous hidden challenges, especially adhering to constantly changing safety regulations. To overcome these, I rely on diligent and continuous training. Addressing these challenges require not just a focus on current standards but also preparing for future changes. I tackle these obstacles with clear strategies: implementing rigorous safety programs, conducting meticulous inspections, and leveraging the expertise shared by colleagues. Gallagher's Role in My Safety Expertise
Standing on the formidable foundation constructed by Gallagher, I carved my niche in the safety landscape. Their resources like regular training programs, preemptive insights into new regulations, and a culture that prioritizes not just compliance but also the human element have sharpened my skills to a fine point. Gallagher's pivotal role in my professional climb cannot be overstated in my ascent to new heights of safety leadership.
My Origins and Journey so Far
The bedrock of my tenure in safety management was laid early on, with degrees in engineering, civil construction, and chemistry. Starting at ENVAC and later Big Apple, USA,, I developed a solid foundation in safety protocols.. When Gallagher Bassett Services, Inc. acquired Total Safety, it marked a significant milestone, providing me with more resources and opportunities for growth, propelled by the vision and mentorship of management.
Staying Current in the Industry
To stay abreast of the rapid currents of the industry, I immerse myself in constant streams of knowledge. From conferences and seminars to the virtual networks spun by professional safety associations like ASSP, I remain vigilant. I am meticulous in compositing knowledge from sources like OSHA and other Gallagher Bassett experts. Engaging with peers and clients and the shared wisdom of other safety directors ensures I am always up-to-date and ever-ready.
My Workweek and Contributions at Gallagher
The tempo of my workweek oscillates between the field and the desk. Inspections and safety briefings, underscored by administrative duties that keep the wheels of compliance and documentation smoothly turning are an integral part of my daily routine. I step in with swift decisiveness when hazards arise, balancing respect for individuals with an unwavering enforcement of policies, ensuring safety resounds as the dominant note in our collective tune.
When I reflect on the value of my contributions, it's not just the safety programs or the emergency plans that resonate—it's the lives preserved. Every precaution, every training session, every emergency drill is crafted with the singular aim of ensuring that each person entrusted to the site returns home unharmed. This is the most profound marker of my legacy: a steadfast commitment to safeguarding life, fortified by the relentless pursuit of safety beyond mere compliance. This dedication to safeguarding life is my legacy and my greatest achievement in the safety field..
