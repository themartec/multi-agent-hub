        "final_content": "Navigating the Future Together: My Journey as a Mentor at Gallagher\nAs the Vice President of Gallagher's Bogot\u00e1 office, I have the privilege of leading a talented team and overseeing all strategic aspects of our local business. With a background in client relationship management and financial risk solutions, I joined Gallagher seven years ago, bringing with me a deep commitment to client satisfaction and operational efficiency. However, one of the most rewarding aspects of my role has been the opportunity to serve as a mentor to the next generation of leaders and professionals within our organization.\nThe Inspiration to Mentor\nMy decision to become a mentor at Gallagher stems from my own experiences with mentors who have supported my growth and helped guide me through challenges. These experiences instilled in me the importance of paying it forward and contributing to the development of others. When I joined Gallagher, I saw an opportunity to shape the future by sharing my insights and experiences with the diverse range of talent within our organization.\nMentoring has not only allowed me to help others grow, but it has also enriched my own professional journey. Engaging with fresh perspectives and innovative ideas of my mentees has challenged me to reflect on my own practices and grow alongside them, creating a dynamic and rewarding learning environment for all involved.\nTailoring the Mentoring Approach\nOne of the key lessons I've learned as a mentor is that a one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work. Every mentee brings their own unique strengths, challenges, and aspirations to the table. To effectively support their growth, I make it a priority to understand their individual needs and career goals through open conversations about their professional background, current challenges, and future aspirations.\nOnce I have a clear understanding of their objectives, I customize my guidance to align with their specific goals. This may involve providing personalized resources, setting attainable milestones, or connecting them with relevant networking opportunities. By tailoring my approach to each mentee, I can ensure that they receive the support and guidance they need to succeed.\nBalancing Guidance and Autonomy\nAs a mentor, one of the most important aspects of my role is giving my mentees the autonomy to take ownership of their decisions empowering them to learn from their experiences. To achieve this balance, I focus on prioritizing active listening and empathy, asking open-ended questions that encourage critical thinking and self-reflection, and understanding that everyone has unique strengths and challenges.\nI also emphasize the importance of learning from mistakes and reassure my mentees that it's okay to fail sometimes, as long as they are learning and growing from the experience. This approach helps build their confidence and decision-making skills over time.\nNavigating Challenges Together\nOne of the most significant challenges I've worked through with a mentee involved navigating the balance between personal ambition and team collaboration. This particular mentee was highly driven and had great potential, but they often found themselves focusing on individual achievements at the expense of building stronger relationships within their team.\nTo help them overcome this challenge, I encouraged them to shift their approach by actively listening to their colleagues and seeking input from others before pushing forward with their own ideas. This experience reinforced the importance of empathy, active listening, and patience, not just as leadership skills, but as key components of successful collaboration.\nThe Rewards of Mentoring\nBeing a mentor at Gallagher has been an incredibly rewarding experience. Seeing my mentees grow, take on new challenges, and succeed in their roles is a testament to the power of mentoring and the impact it can have on an individual's career.\nOne memorable moment that stands out occurred when I was mentoring a colleague who was struggling with transitioning into a leadership role. By focusing on helping him navigate the softer skills required in leadership and encouraging vulnerability, I watched as he grew more comfortable in his role and his team began to respond more positively.\nThese experiences have shown me that small shifts in mindset can have a huge impact on someone's professional growth. Furthermore, it has taught me the importance of being open to learning from others, patient adapting to new situations, and continuously seeking ways to improve myself and my leadership style.\n\nTo anyone considering becoming a mentor at Gallagher, my advice would be to approach the role with a genuine desire to help others grow. Keep your ears open and create an environment where your mentee feels comfortable taking risks, asking questions, and learning from both successes and failures.\nAs we navigate the future together at Gallagher, I am excited to continue my journey as a mentor and to see the impact that our collective efforts will have on the success of our company and the growth of our people."

        "final_content": "Embracing Growth and Navigating the Future at Gallagher\nHi Readers! As a passionate professional in the insurance industry, I am a proud to be a part of Gallagher. Here personal and professional growth is not just encouraged but actively supported. Throughout my journey, I've learned that identifying the skills I need to develop and capitalizing opportunities for improvement are key to thriving in this dynamic field. Gallagher's commitment to growth for the go-getter has been instrumental in my pursuit of upskilling and career advancement.\nMy Journey at Gallagher\nI joined Gallagher in 2022 after working at an insurance agency. Through the Young Professional Program, I had the unique opportunity to rotate across different management areas within Gallagher's Colombian companies, including Retail, Consulting, and Reinsurance. This experience allowed me to understand and work in key areas such as Placement, Customer Service, ART, and various aspects of Reinsurance like FAC and LAC. After completing the program, I transitioned to the Placement area as an analyst in the Property and Casualty management team, where I focused on quoting and placing different accounts of Colombian companies in the insurance market. After 1 year and 10 months, I was promoted to my current role as Assistant Manager of Property and Casualty, continuing my daily work of quoting and placing while also participating in strategic initiatives like overriding commission agreements and handling larger, more challenging accounts.\nIdentifying Skills and Seizing Opportunities\nThe insurance sector presents a steep learning curve, requiring conscious effort and dedication to fully grasp the products, market dynamics, and key players. To grow within the company, in the market, and in front of clients, I've realized the importance of acquiring sufficient knowledge and experience to engage in high-level conversations about insurance, meeting Gallagher's high standards. Through introspection and ambition, I've been able to identify areas for improvement and actively seek out opportunities to enhance my skills.\nGallagher's Support in Learning and Development\nGallagher's employee first is evident throughout my journey. The launch of \u2018The Gallagher College\u2019 in the latter half of 2024 and throughout 2025 has been a game-changer. This initiative offers a blend of in-person and virtual classes, covering topics that are highly relevant to our daily work. As I progress in my current role, the knowledge gained from these courses has been invaluable.\nLearning something new often leads to questioning previous methods and adopting more efficient or innovative approaches. Additional skills make me more competitive in the job market and allow me to explore more advanced roles. Combining knowledge from different areas has undoubtedly opened doors for me along the way, continuously shaping my short, medium, and long-term future within Gallagher.\nBalancing Learning and Responsibilities\nManaging my time effectively between learning and daily responsibilities has been a challenge. With weekly deliverables that require careful management, I've come to prioritize tasks based on importance, blocking out dedicated time for each pending item. I tackle the most critical tasks first and work my way down the list, ensuring that no important issue goes unanswered. I've set a personal goal to respond to emails within a maximum of 3 days to maintain timely communication with stakeholders. With careful planning, I\u2019ve successfully been able to chalk time for my career development.\nAdvice for Newcomers at Gallagher\nFor someone new at Gallagher looking to develop their skills and knowledge, my advice is to focus on building relationships with colleagues. People at Gallagher are always willing to help, and connecting with others is the most powerful tool for growth. The Young Professional Program has been essential to my development, providing me with the advantage of building meaningful relationships with colleagues at Gallagher Colombia. Without their guidance and camaraderie, my progress would not have been possible.\nIn 2022-2023, Gallagher Colombia had a highly successful program that offered a group of employees the opportunity to pursue a specialization in insurance law at the Universidad del Rosario in Bogot\u00e1. The impact of such programs will undoubtedly be reflected in the progress of both the individuals and the company as a whole."

        "final_content": "From Classroom to Boardroom: Learning Beyond the Numbers\nHi there! I'm thrilled to share my experience at Gallagher and how the company has supported me in pursuing learning opportunities that have enhanced my career growth. As a leader in the Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A), I've had the privilege of working with a fantastic team focused on identifying potential acquisition opportunities and ensuring seamless integration processes. Through my journey, I've discovered the importance of continuous learning, strong interpersonal relationships, and the power of a supportive work environment.\nGallagher's Commitment to Employee Development\nOne of the things I love about Gallagher is the company's commitment to employee development. Through mentoring and guidance from my direct supervisor, along with access to advanced courses on the company's intranet and the openness to evaluate external courses, I've been able to acquire skills and knowledge that have been instrumental in my personal growth and the success of my team.\nGallagher's support has allowed us to implement various methods validated in the academic field, adapting them to our industry and reality, with the aim of building a more robust and solid organization. This commitment to learning and development is a testament to Gallagher's dedication to its employees and their professional growth.\nThe Impact of Upskilling on Career Growth\nI recently completed an advanced course in Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) at a local private university, and the support I received from Gallagher was incredible. The Human Resources department and the Finance team provided me with the necessary time and resources to complete the course while ensuring that our commercial and operational focus was not neglected.\nThis experience had a positive impact on me, both personally and professionally, as it reflects a significant level of trust from the company in my career development. In my current role, I've learned that a successful transaction goes beyond just the numbers. Each new addition represents people, stories, and cultures that enrich our diversity and strengthen our essence as an organization.\nGrowth also involves learning from one another, recognizing the strengths each new member brings, and weaving them together with our own to build a more solid future. Numbers are important, but the analysis must go further, taking into account the human aspect of every transaction. I'm eager to share this knowledge with the vision that we can all grow together as a team thanks to these tools.\nBalancing Learning and Responsibilities\nPrioritizing time for learning and development alongside day-to-day responsibilities can be challenging, but I've found that a few key strategies have worked well for me. Maintaining order, managing emails and commitments in a timely manner, and fulfilling them while balancing my personal life and interests have been crucial.\nHonesty, empathy, and transparency in developing my professional, academic, and personal tasks have also been essential. I believe that technical skills should complement personal attributes, as interpersonal relationships are crucial for achieving the goals we set throughout our development journey.\nThe Ideal Upskilling Program\nIf I could design my ideal upskilling program, it would include opportunities, both internal and external, that enable growth not only in the area of specialization but also as well-rounded professionals, according to individual interests. I would love to see growth opportunities not limited to the local level, with internships at the corporate level adding value by allowing employees to experience the Gallagher culture.\nLeveraging the organization's success at the corporate level and extending it to the various subsidiaries that are part of the Gallagher network would be fantastic. This would allow us to align work methods, learn from one another, and adopt best practices to achieve the best possible process.\nThe Importance of People and Culture in M&A\nIf you're new to Gallagher and looking to develop your skills and knowledge, my advice would be to take advantage of the resources available to you. Gallagher is a company that listens to and cares about the concerns of its employees, and the intranet offers a wide range of informational materials, with courses that are comprehensive and educational.\nDon't be afraid to propose growth opportunities, especially in a company of Gallagher's size and global presence, where opportunities are plentiful. It's up to each individual to motivate themselves, get organized, and propose a development project. Remember, motivation must always start from within.\nMy journey at Gallagher has been one of growth, learning, and opportunities. As I continue to lead the M&A area, I'm excited about the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. I'm confident that with teamwork, dedication to service, and a focus on continuous improvement, we'll be able to deliver excellence to our clients and continue to grow as an organization."

        "final_content": "Entrepreneurial Leadership: Transforming Challenges to Growth  \nIn my last 5 years as an Area President at Gallagher, I've had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the power of a business mindset in driving expansion and creating value for our clients. Throughout my journey, I've learned that success isn't just about chasing revenue; it's about fostering a culture that supports innovation, adaptability, and a people-centric approach. In this article, I'll share my experiences and insights on how embracing an entrepreneurial spirit has shaped my career and contributed to Gallagher's success.\nSeizing Opportunities and Creating Value\nOne of the key aspects of being an entrepreneur is the ability to recognize opportunities that others might overlook. I recently encountered a situation where two clients specifically requested teams that represented their organizational demographics and disposition. By understanding the importance of diversity and inclusivity, I was able to engage and assign the appropriate teams, setting us up for success with two high-revenue opportunities. This proactive approach not only met the clients' requirements but also enhanced our reputation as a company that prioritizes cultural understanding.\nDriving Growth through a Positive Culture\nHere, I'm driven by the desire to create an environment that supports a positive culture and community, where each individual has the opportunity to achieve their career goals and self-actualize. I firmly believe that this approach is the catalyst for a growth mindset, enabling our branch to attract and retain top talent while achieving our objectives. It's crucial to recognize that sustainable, profitable advancement is a result of investing in our people and creating a supportive environment.\nChampioning Change and Overcoming Resistance\nImplementing new ideas and strategies often comes with its fair share of challenges. One of the main obstacles I faced was resistance to change from team members who were accustomed to traditional ways of working. To champion this challenge, I focused on clear communication, demonstrating how a developmental attitude could benefit both the team and the organization as a whole. By investing in training and development programs, we equipped our team with the skills needed to adapt to new strategies and market demands, ultimately leading to success.\nInvesting in People for Sustained Success\nIf given an unlimited budget to kick-start a new project at Gallagher, I would invest heavily in training, development, and providing incentives to our people. A people-centric approach is the only way to create sustained success, from basic training to leadership development, mentorships, and collaborating with external trainers. By investing in our people, we build loyalty, confidence, and facilitate effective succession planning. This initiative would enhance our culture, attract top talent, and ultimately lead to innovative solutions that meet client needs and drive business expansion.\nAdvice for Aspiring Entrepreneurs\nFor those looking to embody this personality in their day-to-day role, my advice is to have a clear vision of your goals, create a path to achieve them while remaining flexible in your approach, and seek out both internal and external mentors who will provide open, honest, and unbiased feedback. Take calculated risks and view challenges as opportunities to innovate and improve. Continuously seek out new learning experiences and stay informed about industry trends to keep your entrepreneurial edge sharp.\n\nCollaboration and support are a way of life here and have been instrumental in nurturing my business advancement efforts. The organization\u2019s focus on our people as our enduring strength aligns perfectly with my approach, and our openness to change has been critical as we push to accomplish our organizational and personal goals. This supportive environment fosters innovation and empowers individuals to take initiative and drive their projects forward with confidence.\n\nAs I continue my journey at Gallagher, I am excited to navigate the future together with my team, embracing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. By investing in our people, and staying adaptable, I am confident that we will achieve sustainable growth and success, both for our organization and for the clients we serve.\n"

        "final_content": "HBCU to Gallagher: Navigating Success Through Community, Growth, and Teamwork\nHi there! I'm excited to share my story with you as an HBCU graduate working at Gallagher. As a proud alumna of the illustrious North Carolina A&T State University (NCAT), the experiences at my HBCU have shaped my understanding of community, teamwork, and the importance of being true to oneself. I've carried these values with me throughout my career, and I'm thrilled to be part of a company like Gallagher that supports my growth and aligns with my principles.\nThe Power of Community\nDuring my time at NCAT, I discovered the incredible power of community. Whether it was through organizations like the Student Government Association, American Marketing Association, Aggie Ambassadors, or Management Leadership for Tomorrow, I found countless opportunities to create and be part of a community. These experiences taught me the importance of having safe spaces to be true to myself but also striving to be the best version of myself. \nI've carried this experience of community into my career, always aiming to create a safe space for everyone. I believe that when team members feel confident to be themselves at work, they're more likely to push towards their goals and reach their full potential.\nLabor of Love\nWhen I think about the theme 'African Americans & Labor' in relation to my journey, the phrase 'labor of love' comes to mind. As a young African American woman, my main motivation with every career move has been to ensure that I thoroughly love my day-to-day work. While money and rewards are appreciated, they're never the driving force behind my decisions.\nI'm fortunate to be able to have this mindset, given the history of African Americans and labor. I will continue to approach my career with this perspective while pushing forward and striving for success.\nGrowth and Support at Gallagher\nAt Gallagher, I feel valued and supported as an HBCU graduate. Being asked to share my story is just one example of how the company recognizes and appreciates my background.\nIn my current role as a Sales Enablement Project Manager on the BOR Team, my leadership constantly works with me to ensure that I'm progressing towards my career goals. They support me in sharpening my leadership skills and pursuing higher education opportunities that can further my career. I'm confident that I'm in an environment where I can reach my highest potential, and it's reassuring to know that my team and leadership share this vision.\nThe Importance of Teamwork\nMy HBCU days have taught me that success is a team effort. With every step in my college journey and thereafter, the saying \u2018it takes a village\u2019 has stood true. Everyone has unique strengths and talents that contribute to the greater mission. I believe this mindset is crucial in the workplace as well. When everyone works together, bringing their strengths and talents to the table for a common goal while being open to what others have to offer, it creates a recipe for constant success.\nOf course, not everyone may share this mindset. In those instances, it's important to remind others that there's no 'I' in team.\nGiving Back to the Community\nOne of the most rewarding experiences I've had at Gallagher has been working with the company and the Chicago Blackhawks on community service projects. I've had the opportunity to work with K-12 students in underprivileged communities in Chicago, teaching them leadership skills and learning about their dreams and goals.\nAs an HBCU alum, it's been particularly meaningful to share my experience with students who aspire to attend an HBCU. By showcasing the greatness that the universities have to offer, I feel like I'm growing the community one conversation at a time.\nOne thing I would tell current HBCU students or recent graduates considering a career at Gallagher is, there's a place for you here. Gallagher offers a wide array of career paths, from sales and HR to marketing and beyond. The company's culture is one that values ensuring everyone finds the role that best fits them, not just what's best for the company.\nWhen I first joined Gallagher as an intern, I was given the opportunity to work in different office locations throughout the U.S. and explore various teams within the organization. This experience, along with many other aspects of Gallagher's culture, definitely aligns with my values in a workspace.\nSo, if you're an HBCU student or graduate looking for a company that will support your growth, value your unique experiences, and provide opportunities to give back to the community, Gallagher might just be the place for you. So, let's navigate the future together!"

        "final_content": "Ethical Leadership in Action: Empathy and Integrity\nAt Gallagher, ethical leadership is at the heart of our culture. It's about making decisions that reflect our core values and creating an environment where every team member feels empowered to contribute to our shared success. Join me as I reflect on my 25-year journey at Gallagher and share how we, as leaders, navigate the intersection of business objectives and ethical considerations\nGrowing with Gallagher: From Claims Adjuster to Strategic Initiatives\nMy journey at Gallagher began as a workers' compensation claims adjuster, where I learned the importance of empathy and understanding in serving our clients, their employees, and our business partners. Progressing to a claims manager role and then transitioning to Client Services allowed me to help non-profit and public sector clients like Miami-Dade County Public Schools and The Archdiocese of Miami achieve their missions. These roles shaped my perspective on championing challenges at a portfolio level and emphasized the responsibilities and impact we have on the communities we serve.\nToday, as a member of the Strategic Initiatives team, I focus on enhancing organizational excellence while serving as a leader of our belonging initiative, Include@GB. This role combines my passion for empowering team members with Gallagher\u2019s commitment to fostering an inclusive and ethical workplace where our colleagues feel, seen, supported, connected, and proud of their work and our shared outcomes. \nEmpathy: The Core of Our Operations\nThe Gallagher Way tenet #7, \u201cEmpathy for the other person is not a weakness,\u201d resonates deeply with me. It's the foundation of how we operate and who we are. When clients, their customers and employees interact with us, they're not just looking for relief following a loss; they're seeking our help in navigating difficult situations. Similarly, when we collaborate within our own organization, seeking to understand one another fosters innovation, improves problem-solving, and enhances team cohesion.\nThis ethos extends beyond my professional life work and into our communities. One of the most fulfilling experiences has been volunteering with Give Kids the World, a nonprofit resort providing cost-free vacations for children with critical illnesses and their families. Gallagher's support for this cause demonstrates our shared commitment to giving back. Together, in partnership with our industry colleagues, we\u2019ve raised over $1.2 million for this incredible mission.\nChallenging the Status Quo \nAs leaders, we sometimes face situations where we must challenge the status quo to uphold ethical standards and fairness. In one instance, a client expressed dissatisfaction with their legal partners\u2019 performance, but the reasons for the dissatisfaction were effusive. By leading a project with client stakeholders, law partners, and our claims operation, we discovered that inconsistent expectations and subjective performance assessments were at the root of the issue.\nTo address this, we established an SLA with clear pricing and objective KPIs for all firms, creating a new panel, which was regularly reviewed, and feedback provided. Despite initial resistance, we demonstrated the firms' performance under the new guidelines, ultimately ensuring a fair and stable process for everyone involved.\nAuthentic Leadership Under Pressure\nIf I were to create a fictional \u2018Leadership Code of Ethics for Gallagher,\u2019 the first rule would be: Lead with authenticity, Actions speak louder than words, and when leaders embody the values they wish to instill, they inspire trust and motivate their teams to uphold both excellence and ethical standards. \nHigh-pressure situations, like the COVID-19 pandemic, highlight the importance of authenticity in leadership. As the communications leader, I prioritized delivering the right information to all stakeholders\u2014colleagues, clients, and claimants\u2014at the right time. Acknowledging challenges with honesty and empathy helped foster understanding and resilience during uncertain times.\nBy leading with authenticity and upholding ethical standards, we reinforce the importance of maintaining integrity, especially when the chips are down.\nBalancing Business and Ethics\nNavigating conflicts between business goals and ethical considerations can be an ongoing challenge. In one instance, a client requested an additional service that fell outside the scope of our agreed-upon contract. While it would have been easy to simply agree, doing so would have put our servicing team at a disadvantage in meeting performance guarantees and regulatory requirements.\nBy working with leadership, we proposed a reasonable price increase to accommodate the request and ensure adequate resources for our operation. Ultimately, we agreed upon an alternative that would still achieve the client's desired outcomes while allowing us to be good financial stewards for our colleagues and our organization.\nFostering a Culture of Open Communication\nWhen team members approach me with concerns or dilemmas, my first step is to listen to understand, rather than listening with the intent to reply. It's critical to hear the issue through their thoughts and feelings first. By anchoring counsel or advice to experience and The Gallagher Way tenets, I encourage them to approach challenges rooted in our values, guiding them to solutions that achieve their goals while ensuring integrity in action.\nI strive to create an environment where our team feels safe to have difficult discussions and share ideas. By modeling these behaviors, I aim to set a precedent for open, ethical discussions and collaborative problem-solving.\nLead with Authenticity \nAt Gallagher, we're navigating the future together. Through empathy, authenticity, and a willingness to challenge the status quo, we're creating a culture where every team member can thrive while upholding the highest standards of integrity. It's a journey that requires ongoing effort and dedication, but it's one that will lead us to a bright and successful future."

        "final_content": "\nBreaking Barriers: A Woman's Journey in Construction Safety\nWritten by: Lara McNicol\nAs a female executive in the field of construction safety, I've witnessed firsthand the positive changes that have taken place in this traditionally male-dominated industry over the past three decades. \nFrom starting out as a young professional woman surrounded by male colleagues and managers to now leading a primarily female team, I've seen how fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect has contributed to a safer and more productive workplace.\nThe Impact of Inclusivity on Safety and Productivity\nWhen women feel respected and included, it has a ripple effect on the entire workplace. Safety protocols and equipment are now designed with all workers in mind, including women, resulting in better-fitting personal protective equipment (PPE) and more considerate safety measures. This attention to the specific needs of female workers reduces the risk of accidents and injuries.\nMoreover, an inclusive environment improves morale and job satisfaction, leading to increased productivity and engagement. It also helps to reduce instances of harassment and discrimination, creating a safer psychological environment where women can comfortably work, lead, and contribute effectively to their team.\nDiverse Perspectives and Client Relationships\nThe construction industry has benefited greatly from the diverse perspectives brought by women in various roles. These unique insights and approaches have promoted more efficient, effective, and safe construction processes, fostering innovation and problem-solving.\nAs a woman in construction, I've found that my detail-oriented perspective and ability to offer innovative solutions have been key factors in closing deals and building strong client relationships. Effective communication and active listening have helped me to understand my clients' needs, thereby enhancing their trust and satisfaction.\nNavigating Challenges and Societal Norms\nDespite the progress made, women in construction still face challenges stemming from societal norms and stereotypes. These influences can create barriers that deter women from entering or advancing within the field. However, with the presence of role models and examples of women who have already challenged and altered this landscape, young people are now more encouraged to pursue careers in the industry.\nSome of the challenges I've personally faced include negotiating for fair pay and opportunities, developing a thicker skin to earn my place at the table, and finding ways to connect with peers and clients in an environment that sometimes favored male-centric activities. It's important to remember that having an off day doesn't make you too emotional for the job, and it's okay to take a step back, regroup, and come back stronger.\nFor young women considering a career in construction, I offer the following advice:\n\nSeek out mentors who can provide guidance, support, and advice.\nJoin organizations like the Professional Women in Construction (PWC) or National Association of Women in Construction (NAWIC) to access valuable resources and networking opportunities.\nAdvocate for safety measures that consider the needs of all workers.\nBe confident in voicing your ideas and opinions, as your perspective is valuable.\nSupport and uplift other women in the industry to create a more inclusive and supportive environment.\nBe prepared to face challenges and biases, and develop resilience to overcome obstacles.\nShare your experiences and successes with others to inspire and encourage the next generation of women in construction.\nRemember, you've got this! Whether you're a new face in the industry or a seasoned professional, believe in your abilities and never look back. The construction industry needs your unique perspective and contributions to continue building a safer, more inclusive, and innovative future.\nTo register your interest in working with us, click here: https://jobs.ajg.com/GBTS-registration-of-interest/talentcommunity \n\nQuote for CRM \u2013 do not post this to LinkedIn\nAs a female executive in the field of construction safety, I've witnessed firsthand the positive changes that have taken place in this traditionally male-dominated industry over the past three decades. \nFrom starting out as a young professional woman surrounded by male colleagues and managers to now leading a primarily female team, I've seen how fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect has contributed to a safer and more productive workplace."

        "headline": "Hiring Managers Reveal: What Makes a Great Surveillance Investigator?",
        "final_content": "Mastering the Art of Covert Surveillance: Insider Tips and Success Stories\nCovert surveillance is one tricky business. It's like one of those old spy movies\u2014sneaking around unnoticed, gathering intel without blowing your cover. But unlike the movies, this is real, and must be done correctly. You've got to think on your feet, be keenly aware of your surroundings, and most importantly, stay within the law. Here, I'm going to break down the nuts and bolts of surveillance work, from gearing up for rural tails to inner-city surveillance\u2014all while keeping things above board. And at the end, I'll share some stories which make it all worthwhile!\nWhat Makes or Breaks a Surveillance Mission?\nWhen you're on the lookout, there's a lot at stake. First of all, you've got to determine if the injuries we're checking into are significant\u2014or if the person we're watching is exaggerating. We're talking red flags here: a history of previous accidents, unwitnessed accidents, or the injuries just don't line up with their story. Surveillance comes into play if the claimant's injuries are serious and video footage could help.\nTuning Your Technique to Go Unseen\nWhether you're in a rural location or in the cramped quarters of a city block, you can't just stick out like a sore thumb. In wide-open spaces, you need two sets of eyes, each on a likely departure route. Urban jungle? You must have one investigator in a vehicle, prepared to trail someone should they leave in a vehicle, while another investigator is inside an apartment building, prepared to trail someone on foot. The key? Look like you belong. Wherever you are, blend in and stay sharp.\nFollowing Privacy Laws with Precision\nIt's of major importance to keep up to speed with the dos and don'ts of privacy law. Editing videos is forbidden as all video sent to defense counsel must be shared with plaintiff\u2019s counsel. Not only must you be familiar with rules of evidence; you've also must be aware of trespassing, eavesdropping, and harassment laws as well. \nStaying on top of all current statutes means studying case law, attending legal seminars, and staying in close contact with defense attorneys. \nThe Social Scene: A Digital Playground for Clues\nBefore you even start thinking about sitting in a car with your camera, take a look at their social media. More often than not, they'll lead you right to where you need to be. You'd be surprised how much you can learn about where someone will pop up next just by scrolling through their social media profile. But remember, there's a fine line between sleuthing and snooping. You've got to stay on the right side of the law so you can tell the judge all about what you found, without getting your evidence thrown out.\nWhen Things Get Tough for Surveillance Pros\nEver tried tailing someone who's got a nose for suspicion? Staying out of sight, knowing for sure who you're filming\u2014that's the name of the game. And let's not talk about trying to do your job in high crime neighborhoods where just standing around could land you in a heap of trouble. Even when things are calm, it's no walk in the park to obtain clear video or keep your cool when folks don't follow the script. Then there's the whole tightrope walk of keeping it legal. \nWhen I think back over the years, we've got some great stories.\nTake the story of a construction worker with a hefty $30 million claim for some nasty injuries. We conducted continued surveillance for five years and guess what? His condition improved over time which is great news for the claimant and for us, as we saved the insurer $20 million. \nThen there was the dentist who walked away from a nasty train wreck. When surveillance began, she was using a walker. Over the course of several years, she moved to a cane, and then she appeared to make a complete recovery, walking with not even a limp! We played the long game and bingo, her claim was reduced. \nAnd one more for the road\u2014a back injury so severe they wouldn't be able to work again. Instead, we recorded him lifting heavy loads, and engaging in other strenuous activities. The result? Our evidence proved that the claimant was clearly exaggerating his injuries and we saved the insurance company from paying hundreds of thousands of unwarranted dollars.\n\nThat's the kind of investigation that makes surveillance worthwhile. It's about using your skill to peel back the allegations and serve up some cold, hard facts. It's more than just saving companies a truckload of cash\u2014it's about keeping things fair and square, one case at a time."

        "final_content": "The Power of Recruitment Marketing: How to Attract Top Talent in a Competitive Market\nRecruitment marketing is a critical aspect of talent acquisition that goes beyond simply posting job openings on various platforms. It involves crafting a comprehensive strategy to attract top talent and create a positive candidate experience. Yet, there are common misconceptions about recruitment marketing that need to be debunked. In this article, we will explore the multifaceted nature of recruitment marketing, the impact on candidate experience, the importance of quality job adverts, and how it contributes to building a diverse and inclusive workforce.\n\u00a0\nRecruitment Marketing: Beyond Job Boards\nRecruitment marketing is often mistakenly associated with job boards or social media postings. However, it encompasses much more. It's about employer branding, content marketing, employee referrals, and candidate relationship management. A successful recruitment marketing strategy communicates the company's employer brand and engages potential candidates throughout their entire journey, from initial awareness to the application process. It requires strategic thinking and a deep understanding of the target talent pool.\n\u00a0\nEnhancing Candidate Experience with Recruitment Marketing\nRecruitment marketing plays a vital role in improving the overall candidate experience. By crafting compelling job descriptions, employers can attract top talent and set the right expectations. Additionally, using employee-generated content in the form of videos or blogs can help engage candidates and provide authentic insight into the company culture. A positive candidate experience builds trust and strengthens the employer brand, leading to higher-quality applicants.\n\u00a0\nThe Power of Quality Job Adverts\nThe quality of job adverts has a significant impact on the success of recruitment marketing efforts. Rather than solely relying on generic job descriptions, organisations should focus on creating compelling adverts that resonate with the target audience. Tailoring the messaging to the specific needs and aspirations of potential candidates increases the likelihood of attracting top talent. Additionally, placing the most impactful information at the beginning of the advert captures attention and generates interest.\n\u00a0\nDriving Diversity and Inclusion through Recruitment Marketing\nRecruitment marketing is a powerful tool for fostering diversity and inclusion within the workforce. Simply relying on job boards is not enough; a comprehensive approach is required. Recruitment marketing strategies should aim to reach a diverse range of candidates by leveraging various channels and platforms beyond traditional job boards. By showcasing inclusive company values and promoting equal opportunities, organisations can proactively attract candidates from diverse backgrounds.\n\u00a0\nUtilising Content Marketing for Candidate Engagement\nContent marketing is an integral part of recruitment marketing, enabling companies to create engaging materials for potential candidates. Employee-generated content is particularly effective in this regard. By featuring videos or written blogs created by employees, organisations can provide an authentic perspective of the company culture and working environment. The challenge lies in finding employees who are willing to share their experiences, but the impact of such content can be invaluable in attracting and resonating with potential candidates.\n\nIn conclusion, recruitment marketing is a multifaceted approach to talent acquisition that extends beyond job boards. By adopting a comprehensive strategy, prioritising candidate experience, crafting compelling job adverts, and leveraging content marketing, organisations can attract top talent while fostering diversity and inclusion. Embracing the true essence of recruitment marketing allows companies to elevate their employer brand and build a stronger workforce capable of driving innovation and success.\n\u00a0"
