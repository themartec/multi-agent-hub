        "answer": "One memorable moment that stands out occurred when I was mentoring a colleague who was struggling with transitioning into a leadership role. He had the technical expertise and the work ethic, but he was unsure of how to manage a team effectively and build the right relationships with his colleagues. This lack of confidence was holding him back from fully embracing his leadership responsibilities.\n\nDuring our sessions, I focused on helping him navigate the softer skills required in leadership, such as effective communication, conflict resolution, and building trust within their team. However, the turning point came when we discussed the importance of vulnerability as a leader. I encouraged him to be open with their team about his own learning curve.\n\nNot only did he begin to feel more comfortable in his role, but his team also started responding more positively, opening up with new ideas and taking more initiative.

I had been in my second year of employment, and although not a Senior Claims Investigator yet, I had expressed my interest in taking on more complex cases and projects. My manager trusted in me, and we worked together on a complex insurance fraud network operating in the United States. After weeks of investigating, we submitted our efforts to our client who then submitted it to the State’s Attorney General’s Office for prosecution. Later that year I received the award for my efforts in the project, as well as my overall investigations throughout the year. This recognition and award showed my manager’s trust in my and showed Gallagher will reward those who work hard.",

Probably not like sales training you might see on social media about “waking up at 4 AM to eat 37 egg whites and SLAY THOSE LEADS. ” Moreso, let's focus on how to create human connections and make people comfortable enough to have a conversation.\n\nThe basics include product/company knowledge, fact finding and needs analysis, effective communication, objection handling, negotiation tactics, closing techniques, and building relationships. Next up, the tools you need to make yourself as efficient as possible and how to be a good steward in those systems with your team. Lastly, honing those soft skills to ensure you can stand out in a competitive market. \n",

They have done so with me, and I am very grateful for it.\n\nWe should not fear proposing growth opportunities, especially in a company of Gallagher's size and global presence, where opportunities are plentiful.

From the outset, I noticed that it was a company with a vision of solid growth, focused on service sustainability and, above all, flexible and open to listening to everyone's ideas. This culture, combined with the willingness and excellent treatment of people, motivated me to be proactively involved, even without previous insurance experience, providing ideas and supporting the team with a very good attitude.\n\nMy initial role was to provide support to the sales team, helping them to structure tenders and develop tools for sales. Over time, the team expanded and we went from being just me to having three members. Gallagher was able to identify my key competencies and, together, we created a development plan. This allowed me to evolve from a purely operational and back office job to assuming greater field responsibilities and direct interaction with clients.\n\nCurrently, my position focuses on serving as a facilitator between different areas and, at the same time, maintaining contact with clients. This growth has been part of a strategic plan that seeks to train me as an integral professional, capable of managing both operational and commercial aspects, thus providing a better service and contributing to the success of the organization.",

Too many people especially people new to the world of work believe they must tick every box. The sad reality is that is EXACTLY what is holding them back. Chances are that nobody hold ALL those skills the employer is looking for, and they will have to drop the less important ones - and those are all the missed opportunities, for every employee to progress and move their careers forward.",

Gallagher was among other options for me at the time, but what made choose them over the rest was because my mother knew somebody who worked at a branch and I didn't want to pass up an opportunity to add them to my network. Since joining, I've found that Gallagher and I share the desire to work with good people. You don't get to pick who your coworkers are, and sometimes you get somebody who brings more negativity than anything to the workplace, but Gallagher doesn't hire negative people. If the hiring managers can't see themselves working with negative people, even if they're good at the job, they'll pass them up for someone positive and uplifting instead.",

        "question": "Can you share any experiences where you felt particularly supported or valued as an HBCU graduate at Gallagher?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Six years ago, my close friend/classmate and another young lady were faced with the challenge of the closure of our high school under the University system where we grew up due to limited funding. We were able to secure approval to convert the school to a charter designation and a $40M building structure. It saved the educational experiences for over 400 K-12 students in the community. Upon discussing this endeavor with my then Area President, Luke Kaplan, not only did he create additional awareness within our division, but that exposure also led to additional publicity outside of Gallagher in the form of mentorships and other volunteer led initiatives that enhanced the experiences of kids who greatly appreciated the investment in their future.  Also, during that conversation, Luke connected me with the Early Talent Team that created an accelerated HBCU recruiting focus starting with Grambling St. University. This opened the doors for discussions on future sales and risk management major inclusions Grambling State’s College of Business program as well as recruiting at other HBCUs. By merely putting a spotlight on an accomplishment in the K-12 sector within a small community, it led to other valuable conversations and growth within sectors that showed kids that they were truly seen as citizens of the world. The support that was provided through Luke’s leadership was far beyond what I imagined as it showed me that those things that I valued outside of the work world was also supported within my work world. This let me know that Gallaher is interested in me for more than as an employee. The are interested in me as an extension of the Gallagher tenet that “we support one another…we believe in one another’",

        "answer": "Vendor Management Systems are truly transformational platforms for an enterprise like Gallagher, but they also impact a lot of different areas. It's a services platform which means Procurement needs to be involved; it's an access management platform which means our identity management teams need to be involved; it's a financial platform which means our finance and AP need to be involved; it's a people platform, so it requires oversight from HR and Compliance; and finally we need to have involvement from various technology stakeholders to build all of the integrations required. Additionally, the need to include various cross divisional stakeholders to define all of our use cases. Overall, I would say one of our biggest challenges was ensuring that all of the relevant stakeholders had the appropriate resourcing and dedicated focus on this project.  We championed these challenges by establishing a clear communication plan that outlined the project's scope, goals, and timelines for all stakeholders. Regular meetings were held to ensure alignment and address any concerns or roadblocks. We also created a cross-functional team with representatives from each department to ensure that all perspectives were considered and integrated into the solution. By fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment, we were able to successfully navigate the complexities of the innovation process and drive the project forward towards successful implementation.",

        "answer": "Data analysis and interpretation is the real trick of consulting. Anyone can set up meters and pumps, take picture, write notes, observations and collect mountains of data. But what do you do with it? How can you take this mountain and turn it into an actionable report with conclusions, recommendations and solutions that a lay person can understand. The key is to sift the data and pick out the pieces that are relevant to the project at hand. If we are performing exposure monitoring, then we want to look at the compounds that approach the action levels indicating that a potential hazard could exist. If we are performing a building inspection then we want to know locations where potential hazards may exist and compare that to places where occupants frequent. But most importantly we want to prepare a written report that allows an end user with little to no experience in the field to comprehend and understand the purpose or objective as well as the conclusions and recommendations of the final report. We as consultants are no good to our clients if we cannot relay the information to them in a manner that they can understand and convey to others. In my opinion that is what separates and environmental scientist from an environmental consultant. Scientists collect data, consultants take that data and manipulate it into an end user document. ",

There are so many various roles to explore at Gallagher whether it's within the GGB/GBS/RPS/Gallagher Re divisions or being a Risk Management consultant for your client. When I had first interned, I thought that there was only route for me to pursue and as I have grown in my role, my manager has made it clear that she will provide me with the support needed to be successful in the niche of my choice. This support and flexibility have allowed me to see Gallagher in a whole new light, not just as a company that provides insurance services, but as a place where individual growth and development are truly valued.

        "question": "Have you faced any challenges in maintaining high standards, and how did your innovative-thinking approach help in championing them?",
        "answer": "Yes I have faced few challenges while maintaining the high standards such as consistency, adaptation, limitation of resources and different stakeholder management. \n\nWhen I say consistency, to me it is ensure that I give high quality standard work-day in and day out, but maintaining it across the team and projects can be difficult especially in a large organization like Gallagher.\n\nAdaptation is also one of the major aspect when new technologies or applications are introduced in the organization, maintaining high standards can be difficult because it depends on how quickly we adapt to the change not only as an individual but it also depends on how the entire team or organization adapts to it as well. I faced this challenge when iCIMS was introduced In our organization, its been more than a year and I still find new things to learn now as well\n\nLimitation of resources also plays a crucial role in maintaining high standards as sometimes we do not get the full information from the stakeholders on how things work from their point of view. Sometimes when we get a quick turn around time to complete a project, we may face the challenge to whether to try complete the task as soon as possible or complete the task with quality and without any errors or mistakes\n\nStakeholder Management is also important as they are responsible for providing the information. Sometimes due to hierarchy, we might miss out on few important calls and might not receive the entire information and only receive the filtered  data from our superiors.\n\nMy Innovative thinking solved these challenges by \n\nProblem Solving - It encourages us to creative solutions to overcome resource limitations and barriers\nCollaboration - It helps us in building team work and provides us an opportunity to share best practices, insights and different innovative ideas\nContinuous Improvement - For maintaining the high standards, we will have the mindset of improving ourselves and learn new things everyday to grow as per the organization and the industrial needs\n\nSo to conclude, by having innovative thinking you not only maintain the high standards but it also helps in elevating the organizations standards as well\n\n",

        "answer": "Learning different areas that I might not support and learning that side in order to be stronger and support my current stakeholders when they have questions. It really helps to be \"global\" within a global organization in areas that you might support a bit but to ensure the processes go smoothly from start to finish whether you support an area or not. This has allowed me to build stronger relationships with colleagues in different departments and gain a deeper understanding of how our work interconnects. By being able to step in and offer assistance or guidance in areas outside of my expertise, I have become a more versatile and valuable team member. This unexpected skill has not only improved my own knowledge and capabilities but has also fostered a culture of collaboration and support within our cross-functional teams. It has truly been a rewarding experience to navigate the future together with my colleagues, leveraging our collective strengths to achieve our shared goals.",

        "question": "What is the one piece of advice you would give future interns about championing their internship experience?",
        "answer": "One piece of advice for interns is to ask questions and challenge yourself. It's really the only way to get better in my opinion. When assigned a task, I would recommend clarifying with whoever assigned the task two things:\n\n1) what exactly they want done\n2) how they want it done\n \nNow depending on what it is, there may not be as much room for error. For example, if I was working on an active document in the branch's shared drive, maybe I would make a copy and work on that one, just in case I made a 'big' mistake. This allows you to challenge yourself with less stress while completing the task. I recommend trying to complete the task to the best of your ability and then take it to whoever assigned you the task so they can spot check your work. After interning for two consecutive summers, I believe that struggling a little is actually very beneficial because the mental breakthrough in realizing mistakes or the more efficient way of completing the task is much more significant and it sticks with you. My only tip on all this is don't sit there for an hour struggling, I would say maximum 15-20 minutes of being stuck on one thing, ask for help! This is what the internship is for...you definitely will get out of it what you put into it.",

        "question": "Have you faced any challenges in maintaining high standards, and how did your innovative-thinking approach help in championing them?",
        "answer": "Yes I have faced few challenges while maintaining the high standards such as consistency, adaptation, limitation of resources and different stakeholder management. \n\nWhen I say consistency, to me it is ensure that I give high quality standard work-day in and day out, but maintaining it across the team and projects can be difficult especially in a large organization like Gallagher.\n\nAdaptation is also one of the major aspect when new technologies or applications are introduced in the organization, maintaining high standards can be difficult because it depends on how quickly we adapt to the change not only as an individual but it also depends on how the entire team or organization adapts to it as well. I faced this challenge when iCIMS was introduced In our organization, its been more than a year and I still find new things to learn now as well\n\nLimitation of resources also plays a crucial role in maintaining high standards as sometimes we do not get the full information from the stakeholders on how things work from their point of view. Sometimes when we get a quick turn around time to complete a project, we may face the challenge to whether to try complete the task as soon as possible or complete the task with quality and without any errors or mistakes\n\nStakeholder Management is also important as they are responsible for providing the information. Sometimes due to hierarchy, we might miss out on few important calls and might not receive the entire information and only receive the filtered  data from our superiors.\n\nMy Innovative thinking solved these challenges by \n\nProblem Solving - It encourages us to creative solutions to overcome resource limitations and barriers\nCollaboration - It helps us in building team work and provides us an opportunity to share best practices, insights and different innovative ideas\nContinuous Improvement - For maintaining the high standards, we will have the mindset of improving ourselves and learn new things everyday to grow as per the organization and the industrial needs\n\nSo to conclude, by having innovative thinking you not only maintain the high standards but it also helps in elevating the organizations standards as well\n\n",

Um After I learned what the responsibilities would be, I eagerly accepted, it not only allowed me to transition into a permanent position with Gallagher, but it also gave me the chance to continue assisting injured workers and supporting my team members in branch whenever I was needed. Despite not being in a dedicated desk role, I believe this allows me to bring even more value to the company and enhance my claims knowledge. Additionally, the fact that Gallagher is one of the top TPAS in the industry combined with the opportunity to work remotely, makes this an even more appealing opportunity."

Open communication is key, so I encourage a transparent, two-way dialogue for reporting hazards and sharing suggestions. I involve both teams in developing safety plans that are practical and effective, ensuring everyone is on the same page proactively. Recognizing and rewarding safe practices helps reinforce the importance of safety. I also provide continuous feedback and make adjustments based on team input, while ensuring that management visibly supports and enforces safety initiatives to lead by example.",

        "answer": "A few years back I purchased a new car with Apple Car Play, collision detection and collision avoidance.  They were also a few other bells and whistles as well that made operating it more enjoyable and safer.  However after all those additions it was still a car and the skills I learned to operate it still held true after several decades since I received my driver's license.  The same as with my career. I hold on to the fundamentals I learned over the years.  However being innovative and constantly being on the lookout to make a process even better than before has kept me at the forefront of the industry.  \n\nGallagher supports those who bring innovation and creativity to the job.   In my journey in EHS, I have found that balancing innovation and creativity with stability and reliability is crucial. It's important to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends, while also maintaining a strong foundation of reliable and proven methods. This balance has allowed me to adapt to changing circumstances and continuously improve my work, while also ensuring that I can deliver consistent and dependable results. It's a delicate dance, but one that has been essential to my success in the industry.",

        "question": "What do you consider the most valuable thing you've ever done for [FIELD]?",
        "answer": "One of the most valuable contributions I've made to the safety field is the development and implementation of comprehensive safety programs for high-risk projects. By creating detailed safety protocols and conducting extensive training, I have significantly reduced the incidence of accidents and injuries on construction sites.\n\nAdditionally, my work in emergency response planning has been particularly impactful. By establishing first responder teams and conducting regular drills, I have ensured that all personnel are prepared to handle emergencies effectively. These initiatives have not only improved safety outcomes but have also fostered a culture of safety and preparedness within the organizations I've worked with.\n\nMy document management practices have been appreciated by the Department of Buildings (DOB), Gallagher management, statutory authorities, and clients. I have consistently maintained and updated safety documents, ensuring they are accurate and readily available for inspection. This meticulous approach has enhanced compliance and streamlined safety management processes.\n\nI approach management and workers with respect, while being strict and adhering to policies. Treating my coworkers as a family, I emphasize the importance of safety and ensure everyone understands and follows safety protocols. This balance of respect and strict adherence to safety standards has created a positive and effective safety culture.\n\nMy ability to predict upcoming hazards through experience and teamwork has been crucial. I provide advance notifications and ensure excellent communication about potential hazards and changes in environmental conditions. I make sure that any critical information reaches everyone by personally talking to them, messaging their direct numbers, and emailing the group.\n\nAbove all, I believe that the most valuable thing I have contributed to the safety field is the preservation of life. Every action I take, from implementing safety protocols to conducting training and emergency drills, is aimed at protecting the lives of workers. Ensuring that everyone goes home safely at the end of the day is my highest priority and greatest achievement. This dedication to preserving life has driven me to continuously improve safety standards, foster a culture of vigilance and care, and make a lasting impact on the safety and well-being of all individuals involved in the projects I oversee.",

All identified potential hazards, safety violations and non-compliance are related to the General Contractor and documented. I also investigate any reported accidents, injuries or near-miss incidents that occur in the workplace in which an incident report is prepared, and corrective actions are related to the contractor involved.

        "question": "what challenges do you face in your day to day work?",
        "answer": "As a consultant in the Environmental/Health & Safety industry, the challenges I most commonly face relate to collecting accurate data, and effectively communicating with colleagues, clients, and regulators. \n\nAccurate data collection relies upon technical proficiency. Technical proficiency in turn relies upon possessing an underlying understanding of concepts and best practices, the tools/equipment of the trade, available resources, applicable standards and regulations, and the ability to draw on and apply that general body of knowledge to specific (varied) circumstances. To that effect, you can never be too experienced or too knowledgeable, and the path to self-improvement means embracing one's status as a perpetual student. \n\nThe value of being an effective communicator shouldn't require much exposition. The ability to better communicate with clients or their employees, to understand their needs and/or concerns, to be able to effectively distill obscure technical concepts or standards, and clearly/concisely provide information and actionable advice are just a few examples of how such skills might prove useful or necessary.\n\n",

        "question": "Can you share a success story where your surveillance work led to a significant outcome?",
        "answer": "1- A construction worker sustained a verified and serious injury, with a demand of 30 million dollars. For approx. 5 years, we conducted surveillance which showed that each month, the claimant was making a significant and noticeable recovery. The value of the case is now 10 million (a 20 million dollar saving to the insurance carrier)\n2- a dentist was on a train when it was involved in a serious crash. She initially needed a walker to ambulate. After a year, she needed a cane. The following year, she no longer needed the cane and no longer limped. Surveillance over a period of several years showed that she made great recovery which resulted in large saving for the insurance company.   3- In another case, a claimant alleged a permanent injury and was seeking a large settlement. However, our surveillance revealed that the individual was participating in high-impact sports and other physically demanding activities, completely contradicting their claim of being permanently disabled. This evidence led to a significant reduction in the settlement amount and saved the insurance company a substantial sum of money.\n\n4- Additionally, we had a case where a claimant reported being unable to work due to a back injury. Through our surveillance work, we were able to capture footage of the claimant engaging in heavy lifting and other strenuous activities, proving that their injury was not as severe as they had claimed. This ultimately led to a denial of their disability claim and prevented the insurance company from paying out unwarranted benefits.\n\nThese success stories highlight the crucial role of surveillance investigators in uncovering fraudulent or exaggerated claims, ultimately saving insurance companies significant amounts of money while upholding the integrity of the claims process.",

        "content": "The Power of Recruitment Marketing: How to Attract Top Talent in a Competitive Market\nRecruitment marketing is a critical aspect of talent acquisition that goes beyond simply posting job openings on various platforms. It involves crafting a comprehensive strategy to attract top talent and create a positive candidate experience. Yet, there are common misconceptions about recruitment marketing that need to be debunked. In this article, we will explore the multifaceted nature of recruitment marketing, the impact on candidate experience, the importance of quality job adverts, and how it contributes to building a diverse and inclusive workforce.\n \nRecruitment Marketing: Beyond Job Boards\nRecruitment marketing is often mistakenly associated with job boards or social media postings. However, it encompasses much more. It's about employer branding, content marketing, employee referrals, and candidate relationship management. A successful recruitment marketing strategy communicates the company's employer brand and engages potential candidates throughout their entire journey, from initial awareness to the application process. It requires strategic thinking and a deep understanding of the target talent pool.\n \nEnhancing Candidate Experience with Recruitment Marketing\nRecruitment marketing plays a vital role in improving the overall candidate experience. By crafting compelling job descriptions, employers can attract top talent and set the right expectations. Additionally, using employee-generated content in the form of videos or blogs can help engage candidates and provide authentic insight into the company culture. A positive candidate experience builds trust and strengthens the employer brand, leading to higher-quality applicants.\n \nThe Power of Quality Job Adverts\nThe quality of job adverts has a significant impact on the success of recruitment marketing efforts. Rather than solely relying on generic job descriptions, organisations should focus on creating compelling adverts that resonate with the target audience. Tailoring the messaging to the specific needs and aspirations of potential candidates increases the likelihood of attracting top talent. Additionally, placing the most impactful information at the beginning of the advert captures attention and generates interest.\n \nDriving Diversity and Inclusion through Recruitment Marketing\nRecruitment marketing is a powerful tool for fostering diversity and inclusion within the workforce. Simply relying on job boards is not enough; a comprehensive approach is required. Recruitment marketing strategies should aim to reach a diverse range of candidates by leveraging various channels and platforms beyond traditional job boards. By showcasing inclusive company values and promoting equal opportunities, organisations can proactively attract candidates from diverse backgrounds.\n \nUtilising Content Marketing for Candidate Engagement\nContent marketing is an integral part of recruitment marketing, enabling companies to create engaging materials for potential candidates. Employee-generated content is particularly effective in this regard. By featuring videos or written blogs created by employees, organisations can provide an authentic perspective of the company culture and working environment. The challenge lies in finding employees who are willing to share their experiences, but the impact of such content can be invaluable in attracting and resonating with potential candidates.\n\nIn conclusion, recruitment marketing is a multifaceted approach to talent acquisition that extends beyond job boards. By adopting a comprehensive strategy, prioritising candidate experience, crafting compelling job adverts, and leveraging content marketing, organisations can attract top talent while fostering diversity and inclusion. Embracing the true essence of recruitment marketing allows companies to elevate their employer brand and build a stronger workforce capable of driving innovation and success.\n \n"
